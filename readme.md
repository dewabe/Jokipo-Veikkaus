# Jokipo veikkaus

Guess the result of the match. Better you guess, more points you get.



Not really well commented project. Uses Flask, and SQLite as default database.
For Mestis (ice hockey league in Finland) matches, currently only games of Jokipojat (both home/away).

There are lots of ideas how to improve the application/game, like Facebook integration (no extra registration/login required!), to all possible Mestis teams (and other leagues) and so on...
